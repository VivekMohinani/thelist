# thelist
A Golang application to provide RESTful development learning examples.


## Introduction
This current code was built using the Honeybadger guide linked below.  
- [A step-by-step guide to creating production-ready APIs in Go with Gin and Gorm](http://example.com/page)

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to provide clear and concise examples of RESTful development using popular development tools that can be referenced by developers at all stages of their career. I will also be adding information about all VSCodium configurations and plugins used so anyone who comes across this can configure a free open source editor to their liking.

## Tooling
- Golang
- VSCodium
